Inc-Ex - Report redundant includes in C/C++ code
================================================

Inc-Ex is a simple C program that reports redundant, i.e.  unreferenced
headers included in a C/C++ source file. It uses the Clang, a front-end
for the LLVM compiler.

Feel free to send feedback and bug reports to:
	Jonas Gehring <jonas.gehring@boolsoft.org>
or fork the project at:
	http://github.com/jgehring/inc-ex


Usage
-----
Please refer to the INSTALL document first. Afterwards, the incex
executable can be used like a compiler. For a normal make-based program,
the following commands can be used:

	$ make clean
	$ make -s -k CC=incex

The -k switch may be necessary, since Inc-Ex won't produce object files
and won't link them. For C++ projects, use CXX=incex instead.

Currently, Inc-Ex reports two issues:

	* Unreferenced header: A header is included using #include, but none
	  of its symbols is used in the source file
	* Indirectly referenced header: A header is included using #include,
	  and although non of its symbols is used in the source file, the
	  header includes other headers which are required. This won't be
	  reported for C++ wrapper headers without extensions.


Known Bugs
----------
Currently, false positives will be reported if headers are included
multiple times and resulting in different contents. Please see
tests/t2.cpp.in for an example.
