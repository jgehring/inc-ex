Inc-Ex - Report redundant includes in C/C++ code
================================================

Installation should be simple: Make sure that you've installed the
LLVM and Clang development files (headers and libraries, I've tested it
with version 2.9). If necessary, adjust the first few variables in the
Makefile. Afterwards, run 'make' to build the program.

Finally, you might want to copy the "incex" program to /usr/local/bin
or similar.
