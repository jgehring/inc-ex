Inc-Ex - Report redundant includes in C/C++ code
================================================

Installation should be simple: Make sure that you've installed the
LLVM and Clang development files (headers and libraries). If necessary,
adjust the first few variables in the Makefile. Afterwards, run 'make'
to build the program.

Finally, you might want to copy the "incex" program to /usr/local/bin
or similar.
